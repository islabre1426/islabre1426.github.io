## What's this?
This is my Terminal-based Portfolio, mostly for showcasing my works,  skills to the world, and my passion about the Terminal.

## Why Terminal-based?
I work with the terminal a lot since this is what many programmers use to develop.

I think it is a good idea to develop a Portfolio based on my passion.
